Description:

There are multiple reasons for choosing the topic of my project. The first reason is that I understand the struggle of living at a remote
location and not having time to go all the way to the grocery store and back. Secondly, people at certain age experience harder time walking
and it can be really hard to go to a supermarket then walk around to get what they need. Last but not least, let's admit it, some of us are
couch potatoes or in other words pretty lazy, and like when we don't need to get out of home.

This application is about delivering grocery products to people's houses. The user can choose a supermarket and see a list of their products.
While scrolling the list the user can add items to his/her virtual cart, as well as remove them from there. After the user has chosen all the
needed items it can proceed to review the items and their price added in the cart and finish the purchase by ordering them. The user will also
be able to see if the delivery is accepted and the estimated delivery time.
